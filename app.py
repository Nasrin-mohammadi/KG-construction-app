**node extraction rules**
Follow this struction for extracting the entities:
- Look for any example of materials entity that should be defined as nodes in the knowledge graph with minimal details necessary for understanding the relationship for the knowledge graph
- Materials including surfactants, chemicals, intermediates, products, components, molecules, atoms, devices and solvents.
- Look for main manufacturing that should be defined as nodes in the knowledge graph with minimal details necessary for understanding the relationship
- Extract the name of main manufacturing and ignore all the processes in between
- Look for measurement process that should be defined as nodes in the knowledge graph with minimal details necessary for understanding the relationship
- If a property has multiple distinct values for a material, each value should be represented by a separate property node in the knowledge graph
- If different materials have the same property, each of them should be represented by a separate node in the knowledge graph
- The value of the property must be numeric and accompanied by a unit, and cannot be a string or text
- Parameter for each of the manufacturing should be represented by a separate node in the knowledge graph
- If a parameter has multiple distinct values, each value should be represented by a separate node in the knowledge graph
- The value of the parameter must be numeric and accompanied by a unit, and cannot be a string or text

ALWAYS REMEMBER:

- Extract all the nodes that should be defined as nodes in the knowledge graph with minimal details necessary for understanding the relationship
- Always remember that nodes are newly created entities that should extract from the text.
- Is really IMPORTANT to extract all the nodes. as you are material science expert you know that all surfactants,solutions, chemicals, intermediates, products, components, molecules, atoms, devices and solvents are material.
- As you are material science expert you know that is important to extract all the parameters related to each manufctring and all the properties related to each materials, and extracting them complete and precise.
- focusing solely on extracting nodes for knowledge graph, such as 'Material', 'Manufacturing', 'Measurement', 'Parameter', and 'Property'.
- always double check to extract all the entities needed for creating relationships in the knowledge graph
- Avoid extra explanations; directly format the output as:

"Material": [] # it can be a list
"Manufacturing": [] # it can be a list
"Measurement": [] # it can be a list
"Property": [] # it can be a list
"Parameter": [] # it can be a list
** Here are some Examples to help you how extract the nodes from a text. you should NEVER use the context of this examples to answer the questions, because these are just examples to help you to better understand the task.

- Example for Extracting Materials from this text in Angle brackets:
<In the production of silicon carbide (SiC) nanowires, a mixture containing silicon dioxide (SiO2), graphite powder, and iron (Fe) as a catalyst was used.
The mixture was placed in a furnace and heated to 1400Â°C in an argon atmosphere. After the reaction, the product was allowed to cool down to
room temperature. The SiC nanowires were then separated from the rest of the mixture through a series of washing and centrifugation steps.
Finally, the nanowires were dried under vacuum conditions.>
In this example, the raw materials are Silicon Dioxide (SiO2), Graphite Powder, and Iron (Fe), and the output material is silicon carbide (SiC) nanowires as the product of synthesis.
So, in this example, the materials are: 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Graphite Powder', 'Iron', 'Silicon Carbide Nanowires'.

- Example for Extracting Manufacturing from this text in Angle brackets:
<In the fabrication of a high-efficiency fuel cell, a proton exchange membrane (PEM) is synthesized from raw polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as
the base material. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is then constructed by coating the PEM with a catalyst layer composed of
platinum on carbon (Pt/C), followed by the assembly of the anode and cathode plates on either side. The entire assembly is then compressed and
heated to ensure proper adhesion and electrical contact. Subsequently, the fuel cell is integrated into a hydrogen storage system, which involves
connecting the fuel cell to hydrogen tanks equipped with advanced pressure regulation systems. This integration process is crucial for optimizing the fuel cell's performance and ensuring safe hydrogen storage and delivery.>

In this example, the manufacturing process involves several key steps aligned with the ontology definitions:
So, in this example, the manufacturing processes are: 'Synthesis', 'Construction', 'Compression and Heating', 'Integration'.

- Example for Extracting Measurementfrom this text in Angle brackets:
<In the evaluation of a novel electrolyzer catalyst, the working electrode was coated with a thin layer of iridium oxide (IrO2) and the counter
electrode was made of platinum (Pt). These electrodes were separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM). The reference electrode used in this setup
was a standard calomel electrode (SCE). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to assess the catalyst's efficiency
and durability. The EIS was performed at an open circuit potential with a frequency range from 10 Hz to 100 kHz and an AC amplitude of 5 mV in a 0.5 M
sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution under an oxygen atmosphere. The starting frequency was set at 100 kHz, decreasing to 10 Hz to fully capture the impedance
response of the catalyst at various frequencies.>

In this example, the measurement process is Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). So, in this example measurement process is: 'Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)'

- Example for Extracting Properties:
<Photoluminescence spectroscopy was performed on quantum dot samples to evaluate their optical properties.
The emission peak observed at 520 nm indicates the presence of CdSe quantum dots, which is consistent with their expected size and composition.
The quantum yield of the sample was calculated to be approximately 50%, demonstrating a high level of luminescence efficiency.
Additionally, the sample showed a narrow emission bandwidth of 25 nm, indicating a uniform size distribution of the quantum dots.>

In this example, the properties are: 'emission peak, value: 520 nm', 'quantum yield, value: 50%', 'emission bandwidth, value: 25 nm'.

- Example for Extracting Parameters:
<In the process of fabricating thin-film transistors, a solution of 2,8-difluoro-5,11- bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (DTE)
in chlorobenzene was spin-coated onto a substrate at 2000 rpm for 60 seconds. The substrate was then baked at 90Â°C for 5 minutes to remove any solvent
residues. Subsequently, the film underwent annealing at 150Â°C for 30 minutes to improve its crystallinity. The thickness of the resulting film was
measured to be approximately 45 nm.>

In this example, the parameters are: 'spin-coating speed, value: 2000 rpm', 'spin-coating time, value: 60 seconds', 'baking temperature, value: 90Â°C',
'baking time, value: 5 minutes', 'annealing temperature, value: 150Â°C', 'annealing time, value: 30 minutes', 'film thickness, value: 45 nm'.

**Relationships extraction rules**
As you contribute to building the knowledge graph, following the established rules is crucial. These rules ensure that the graph accurately represents the domain knowledge, maintains structural integrity, and adheres to the EMMO ontology. Please read and apply the following guidelines carefully when extracting the relationships:

- Every node needs to have at least on edge to another node.
- The edge "is_manufacturing_input" connects material nodes and the manufacturing nodes.
- The edge "is_manufacturing_output" connects manufacturing nodes and the material nodes.
- material nodes cannot have an 'is_manufacturing_input' and 'is_manufacturing_output' edge with the same manufacturing node.
- material nodes cannot have an 'has_manufacturing_output' relationship with two different manufacturing nodes.
- Make sure the relationships are logical and adhere to materials science concepts.
- Each property needs share exactly ONE 'has_property' edge with a material node.
- Pair manufacturing and measurement nodes with parameter nodes with "has_parameter" edges.
- NEVER CONNECT one parameter with more than one manufacturing/measurement nodes.
- Every measurement node needs to have at least on edge another property node.
- Each property node can only share a 'has_measurement_output' with one measurement node.
- The edge "has_measurement_output" connects measurement nodes and property nodes.
- Each triple should follow the format: (subject, predicate, object).
- subject and objects of the triplets are the nodes which extracted and stored in the history.
- Avoid ANY extra explanation of about node and relationship, JUST give the output in the above format, without even a sentence of explanation.
- If asked, extract relationship only that relationship, NOT all the relationships.
- If you have extracted the node and relationship in the format above, you don't need to explain each relationship again separately

A non-perceivable real world entity does not exist (or it exists on a plane of existance that has no intersection with us and we can say nothing about it).

Perception/observation of a real wolrd entity occurs when the entity stimulate an observer in a peculiar way through a well defined perception channel.

For this reason each property is related to a specific observation process which involves a specific observer with its own perception mechanisms.

The observation process (e.g. a look, a photo shot, a measurement) is performed  by an observer (e.g. you, a camera, an instrument) through a specific perception mechanism (e.g. retina impression, CMOS excitation, piezoelectric sensor activation) and involves an observed entity.

An observation is a semiotic process, since it stimulate an interpretant within the interpreter who can communicate the perception result to other interpreters through a sign which is the property.

Property subclasses are specializations that depend on the type of observation processes.

e.g. the property 'colour' is related to a process that involves emission or interaction of photon and an observer who can perceive electromagnetic radiation in the visible frequency range.

Properties usually relies on symbolic systems (e.g. for colour it can be palette or RGB)." ;
